# Job Application Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Updated

### 1. **Job Model** (`job.dart`)
- Added `requiredSkills: List<String>` field
- Parser now handles `required_skills` from database

### 2. **Job Details Modal** (`job_details_bottom_sheet.dart`)
- **Budget Section**: Now shows budget with required skills badge next to it
  - Shows icon + skill count (e.g., "🔧 2 skills")
  
- **New Required Skills Section**: Displays all required skills
  - Skills shown as styled badges with secondary color
  - Only displays if skills exist
  
- **Apply Button**: Now actually submits to Supabase database

### 3. **Application Data Source** (`application_data_source.dart`)
- **Replaced dummy in-memory implementation with Supabase**
- Methods now:
  - `submitApplication()` → INSERT into `applications` table
  - `getUserApplications()` → Query user's applications
  - `hasApplied()` → Check if user already applied
  - `withdrawApplication()` → Update status to withdrawn

### 4. **Home Repository** (`home_repository_impl.dart`)
- Updated `filterJobsBySkill()` to filter by `requiredSkills` field
- Falls back to title/description matching if no skills set

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### applications table (NEW)
```sql
CREATE TABLE applications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id UUID NOT NULL → jobs.id
  user_id UUID NOT NULL → profiles.id
  cover_letter TEXT
  status TEXT ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'withdrawn')
  applied_at TIMESTAMP
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
  created_at TIMESTAMP
  UNIQUE(job_id, user_id) -- Prevent duplicate applications
)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_applications_user_id` - Fast lookup by user
- `idx_applications_job_id` - Fast lookup by job
- `idx_applications_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_applications_applied_at` - Sort by date

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can only read/create/update their own applications
- Job providers can read applications for their posted jobs

## 🔧 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Applications Table
Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
```
File: create_applications_table.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Flow
1. Go to Home screen
2. Click on any job card
3. View required skills in the modal ✓
4. Click "Apply Now"
5. Check Supabase: Should see new row in `applications` table
6. Click same job again: Should show "Already applied" message

### Step 3: Future Features
- [ ] Email notifications when app receives application
- [ ] Job provider dashboard to view applications
- [ ] Accept/Reject applications
- [ ] Job completion and rating system
